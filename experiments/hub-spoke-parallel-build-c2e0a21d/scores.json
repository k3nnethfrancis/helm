      "justification": "The system exhibited significant duplicated work and wasted effort across several areas. All four workers began building their subcommands independently before receiving the orchestrator's architecture decision, resulting in abandoned initial implementations (find-worker wrote src/find.py with typer, rename-worker wrote src/output.py and src/rename.py outside the filekit package). The orchestrator issued three overlapping architecture decisions (001-shared-architecture.md, 001-architecture.md, 001-integration-standard.md) that conveyed largely the same information, burning tokens on redundant coordination. Workers repeatedly read the same files (utils.py, cli.py, __init__.py) across multiple cycles \u2014 find-worker read utils.py at least 4 times, cli.py at least 4 times. The dedupe-worker re-implemented hash_file locally in its first version despite it being available in utils, then had to rewrite. Multiple file write attempts failed due to 'File has not been read yet' errors, causing retry loops. However, all four subcommands were ultimately produced and the CLI integrated successfully, so the waste didn't prevent completion.",

The workers then spent significant effort re-reading files, re-adapting their implementations, and cleaning up stray files \u2014 wasted work that wouldn't have occurred with clearer initial coordination.
